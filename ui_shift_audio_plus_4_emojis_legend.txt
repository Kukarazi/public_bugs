Story of finding:
I was using a telegram app as usual, just chatting with my friend. Then I send an audio and he reacted with a set of 3 emojis. After that I reacted with one different emoji and the bug appeared. 

Summary:
There is a UI shift in audio message when using multiple emojis.

Steps to reproduce:
1.Open chat with any person that have telegram premium.
2.Send an audio message to that person.
3.Let that person react with any 3 emojis under that audio message (e.g. 🌭 😁 🙏)
4.React with any emoji under the same audio message (e.g. 💯)
5.Bug appeared.

Actual Result:
The last reacted emoji extends beyond the UI boundaries of the audio message.

Expected result:
The last reacted emoji stays in the boundaries of UI message.

Reproduction:
Stable

Environment:
Android 12 SKQ1.211006.001, Xiaomi POCO X3 pro, app version 11.3.1
